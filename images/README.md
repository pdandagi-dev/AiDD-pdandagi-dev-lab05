# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the personal portfolio website.

## Required Images

To complete the website, you'll need to add the following images:

### Profile Images
- `profile.jpg` - Professional headshot for the About page (200x200px recommended)

### Project Screenshots
- `project1-screenshot.jpg` - E-Commerce Platform screenshot
- `project2-screenshot.jpg` - Task Management Application screenshot
- `weather-app.jpg` - Weather Dashboard screenshot
- `blog-platform.jpg` - Blog Platform screenshot
- `recipe-app.jpg` - Recipe Finder App screenshot

## Image Guidelines

1. **Profile Photo**: Should be a professional headshot, well-lit, and appropriate for a portfolio website
2. **Project Screenshots**: Should clearly show the application interface and key features
3. **File Formats**: Use JPG for photographs, PNG for screenshots with text
4. **File Sizes**: Optimize images for web use (under 500KB each)
5. **Alt Text**: All images have proper alt text attributes for accessibility

## Placeholder Images

For development and testing purposes, you can use placeholder images from services like:
- https://via.placeholder.com/
- https://picsum.photos/
- https://unsplash.com/

Example placeholder URLs:
- Profile: `https://via.placeholder.com/200x200/3498DB/FFFFFF?text=Profile+Photo`
- Project screenshots: `https://via.placeholder.com/400x200/2C3E50/FFFFFF?text=Project+Screenshot`

## Adding Images

1. Save your images in this directory
2. Ensure filenames match the references in the HTML files
3. Test that all images load correctly
4. Verify alt text is descriptive and appropriate
